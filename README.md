# ooRexx-git

This is a mirror of the SourceForge-based ooRexx svn repo. It is being kept current daily.
It is not the official ooRexx repository but intended as a way to make building ooRexx easier for those do not have running Subversion installations.

When the mirroring is automated, this line will be deleted.
