2022-12-15, Release Steps for ooRexx 5.0.0 as a role model

- create a branch for 5.0.0 using current trunk (if no show stopper errors occur
  running the ooRexx testsuite); here the svn command for code and documentation
  (replace "userId" with yours)

        svn copy --username=userId svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/main/trunk svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/main/branches/5.0.0  -m "Creating code branch 5.0.0 to prepare release."
        svn copy --username=userId svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/docs/trunk svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/docs/branches/5.0.0 -m "Creating docs branch 5.0.0 to prepare release."

- update the ooRexx version related information in trunk to "5.1.0"

  cf. <http://sourceforge.net/p/oorexx/code-0/12539> changes to:

        main/trunk/CMakeLists.txt
        main/trunk/platform/windows/rexx32.exe.manifest
        main/trunk/platform/windows/rexx64.exe.manifest

  and cf. <http://sourceforge.net/p/oorexx/code-0/12540>

        main/trunk/api/oorexxapi.h

- Suggestion for a time table:

    t0: if the tests on Jenkins show no show-stopper errors from the latest trunk, then create the branch: ASAP
    t1: apply the necessary changes in the branch (version information update, release information update):  < =(t0+7 days)
    t2: create the installation packages from the branch and upload them to a staged directory "5.0.0": after a week (t1+1)
    t3: communicate the availability: t2+1

- create on Sourceforge:

        oorexx/files/5.1.0beta        ... to receive the new builds from trunk
        oorexx/oorexx-docs/5.1.0beta  ... to receive the new documentation from trunk

        oorexx/files/5.0.0_Release_Candidate        ... to receive the tested builds from branches/5.0.0
        oorexx/oorexx-docs/5.0.0_Release_Candidate  ... to receive the new documentation from trunk

- adjust the build scripts on Jenkins and feed the 5.0.0_Release_Candidate and the 5.1.0beta folders
  for code and documentation

- release information:

        update branches/5.0.0./CHANGES (a text file) to document all changes from the last release
        for

                - Bugs
                - Feature-requests
                - Documentation
                - Patches

??      1) all items with the status "accepted" need to be checked to see whether they
           have been worked on such that they can be changed to "pending"

        2) all items with the status "pending" get included in CHANGES (the text file
           located in trunk)

??      3) all items with the status "pending" get changed to "closed"

        4) a "Milestone 5.1" needs to be created, just did it, here the steps needed
           for "Bugs":

                - pick "Administration"
                - click on the lock icon in the upper hand corner
                - click on the "Tickets" menu and then on the changed config "icon"
                  left of the text "Bugs"
                - choose "Options"
                - add "5.1.0" to "Milestones" which represents ooRexx version numbers
                  offered when new bugs get created

??                ... this option page would allow to delete Milestones; which ones
                      should we delete

- release

        - rename the folders from "5.0.0_Release_Candidate" to "5.0.0"

        - announce the new release on the ooRexx related e-mail lists,
          RexxLA e-mail list, BSF4ooRexx related e-mail lists

          - ask the reader to forward the announcement to related e-mail lists
            they participate (like the various IBM e-mail lists, other related
            open-source e-mail lists and projects)


- overall timetable estimate:

        - t0: if the tests on Jenkins show no show-stopper errors from the latest
              trunk, then create the branch

        - t1: create the installation packages from the branch and upload them to a
              staged directory "5.0.0"

        - t2: apply the necessary changes in the branch (version information update,
              release information update): within (t0+7) days the longest

        - t3: communicate the availability: t2+1
